SYNTHETIC WSTX WITH GENERIC CROSS-CHAIN MESSAGING
Nikos Baxevanis
2024-11-30

ABSTRACT
This paper describes a system for using synthetic WSTX as an ERC-20 token on
Ethereum. The system locks STX on the Stacks blockchain and mints a synthetic
equivalent on Ethereum. It uses a generic cross-chain messaging protocol to
handle communication between the Stacks and Ethereum blockchains, along with a
decentralized relayer network to track and verify events.

INTRODUCTION

PROBLEM
STX is native to Stacks and tied to Bitcoin finality. But it cannot interact with
Ethereum DeFi systems. Users cannot use STX or its derivatives in Ethereum
protocols without a bridge.

SOLUTION
This system introduces synthetic WSTX, backed 1:1 by STX locked on Stacks. It
uses a generic cross-chain messaging protocol. Users lock STX on Stacks to mint
synthetic WSTX on Ethereum.

ARCHITECTURE

LOCKING STX ON STACKS
1. A lock contract on Stacks receives STX.
2. The contract emits an event.
3. Relayers watch these events and produce proofs for Ethereum.

MINTING SYNTHETIC WSTX
1. On Ethereum, a mint contract checks the proof.
2. The contract mints synthetic WSTX.
3. The user gets synthetic WSTX in their Ethereum wallet.

UNLOCKING STX
1. User burns synthetic WSTX on Ethereum.
2. The burn event is forwarded to Stacks.
3. The lock contract on Stacks releases STX.

COMPONENTS

RELAYERS
Relayers watch the Stacks contract and submit proofs to Ethereum. They get fees.

CROSS-CHAIN MESSAGING PROTOCOL
A messaging layer links Stacks and Ethereum to handle deposit and burn events
reliably.

CONTRACTS
- Lock Contract (Stacks): Holds STX and emits events.
- Mint Contract (Ethereum): Mints and burns synthetic WSTX.
- Burn function: Releases STX when synthetic WSTX is burned.

BENEFITS
- Compatibility: Access Ethereum DeFi with synthetic WSTX.
- Security: STX stays locked on Stacks, tied to Bitcoin finality.
- Decentralization: No central authority.

MONETIZATION STRATEGIES

REVENUE FROM TRANSACTION FEES
- Minting fee (e.g., 0.3%) when users lock STX.
- Burning fee (e.g., 0.3%) when users redeem STX.
These fees fund keeper rewards and generate profit.

KEEPER SUBSIDY VIA USER-PAID GAS FEES
Keepers get a share of minting/burning fees, so they stay self-funded.

PROTOCOL-OWNED LIQUIDITY (POL)
The protocol provides liquidity to WSTX pools on Ethereum DEXs, earning fees.

STAKING AND YIELD FARMING
Users can stake synthetic WSTX to earn rewards. The protocol takes a small cut
(e.g., 10%).

LAUNCH TOKEN FOR GOVERNANCE AND REWARDS
A governance token (e.g., WSTXG) manages the protocol. Some fees buy back and
burn this token.

PREMIUM FEATURES FOR USERS
Offer premium perks, like lower fees and faster service, for a subscription fee
or holding governance tokens.

TOKENOMICS
- Synthetic WSTX Supply: Backed 1:1 by locked STX.
- Fees: Fund keeper rewards and treasury.
- Utility: Trade, stake, or use WSTX in Ethereum protocols.

NEXT STEPS
1. Deploy lock and mint contracts.
2. Integrate cross-chain messaging.
3. Set up a relayer network with incentives.
4. Run audits.

POTENTIAL ISSUES AND RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
- Trust Assumptions: Current reliance on relayers introduces trust. Consider
  rotating relayer sets or decentralized oracle networks to reduce reliance
  on a single party.
- Protocol Complexity: Multiple components increase complexity. Provide clear
  diagrams, state machines, and workflow documentation to ease audits and
  maintenance.
- Regulatory Ambiguity: The paper acknowledges compliance but lacks concrete
  guidance. Consider modular compliance logic for adapting to various
  jurisdictions and offer detailed guidance where feasible.
- Oracles and Data Feeds: Pricing references are not detailed. Document how
  price oracles are selected, verified, and incentivized.
- Security and Verification: Employ formal verification, thorough audits, and
  bug bounties. Maintain contingency plans if relayers fail, collude, or
  participation drops.

CONCLUSION
This system lets STX interact with Ethereum DeFi through synthetic WSTX. It uses
a generic messaging layer and a decentralized relayer network. This expands STX
utility while keeping security intact.

LEGAL AND TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Regulatory Classification: Synthetic WSTX might be treated as a derivative or
  security. Some places might need registration.
- Jurisdictional Variability: Laws differ. Specific analysis may be needed.
- Enforceability of Disclaimers: Courts may ignore blanket disclaimers.
- AML/KYC Compliance: If considered financial transactions, AML/KYC may apply.
- Tax and Investor Protection: Regulators might watch tax and investor issues.

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Security of Cross-Chain Bridges: Complexity could allow exploits.
- Smart Contract Risks: Bugs can cause losses. Audits are critical.
- Decentralization and Reliability: Relayers must stay active. Collusion or drop
  in participation can disrupt operations.
- Maintaining the Peg: The 1:1 backing can break if attacked. Trust depends on
  proper locking and redemption.
